    <h1>Welcome to Our Recipes</h1>

    <p>Sign in to add a recipe or view your recipes, or filter through recipes on this page.</p>
    <p>Todo: Ability to sign in. No account creation. Ability to view and filter all recipes from this page, with a link to the recipe page itself. 
        When signed in there is a user specific page with their recipes filter. There's links to a "recipe-view" file for each reciple, if you're the author then there's a link to a recipe-edit file maybe?
        Can we find somewhere better to host this?
